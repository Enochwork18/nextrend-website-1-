# ðŸš€ Pull Request: Dark Mode, Discover Fix, and Placeholder Pages

## Summary

This pull request introduces several key features and a critical bug fix:

### Light/Dark Mode Support
* Integrated `next-themes` with Tailwind CSS (`darkMode: "class"`) to provide consistent light and dark themes across the application.  
* Added `ThemeToggle` component to the Navbar.  
* User preferences persist in `localStorage`.  

### New Placeholder Pages
* `/privacy` â†’ Privacy Policy  
* `/terms` â†’ Terms of Service  
* `/support` â†’ Support/FAQ  
* `/blog` â†’ Blog/Case Studies  

### Discover Page Fix
* Refactored the `/discover` page to resolve a build error caused by `useSearchParams()` without a Suspense boundary.  
* Moved page logic into a new client component.  
* Introduced a layout with a Suspense wrapper.
