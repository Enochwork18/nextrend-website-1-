üõ† Replit AI Task ‚Äî NexTrend Frontend Update (Fix + Continue Work)

Branch Name (use this for all work):
feature/frontend-ui-update

‚úÖ Context (what‚Äôs already done)

I‚Äôve already implemented:

Navigation updates (Pricing, Contact, Support for guests; Home, Discover, Keywords, AI Trend, Upgrade for logged-in users).

Homepage hero changes (mockup video, typewriter animation with 3 taglines).

Keywords page redesign (renamed to "Research Tools", enhanced filters, dropdowns, Quick Stats sidebar).

Discover page (Trending Videos filters: Outlier Score, Views, Publishing Date).

Login/Signup modal improvements (Cancel ‚ùå button, cleaner flow).

Dark/Light mode toggle (using next-themes, works + persists).

So most features are working.

‚ùå Current Problem

When I run the site, I get:

Uncaught Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function 
(for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file 
it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports. 
Check the render method of `HomePage`.


Bolt tried to fix it and noted errors in components/Navbar.tsx:

An unclosed <Button> tag

An extra closing parenthesis at the end of the return

üéØ What I need Replit AI to do

Fix syntax errors in components/Navbar.tsx.

Ensure all <Button> tags are properly opened and closed.

Remove the duplicate ) at the end of the return.

Make sure imports/exports are correct (default vs named).

Verify all components are exported/imported correctly.

Check HomePage, Navbar, Hero, LoginModal, etc.

Confirm default exports where required (export default Component)

If using named exports, update imports accordingly.

Run the app after fixes and confirm:

No more Element type is invalid errors.

Navbar renders properly with updated items.

Hero section still shows mockup video + typewriter animation.

Dark/Light toggle still works.

Login/Signup modal opens with cancel button.

Leave // TODO comments where backend logic should later be added (auth, predictions API, etc).

üìå Important Notes

Keep the existing UI design. No redesign.

Dark/Light mode must not be broken by these fixes.

Focus only on frontend syntax + structure fixes ‚Äî not backend integration.

Make sure changes stay responsive + accessible.
