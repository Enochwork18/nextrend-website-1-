# üõ† Replit AI Task ‚Äî NexTrend Frontend Update (Fix + Push to GitHub)

*Branch Name:*
feature/frontend-ui-update

---

## ‚úÖ Context (what‚Äôs already working)

* Navigation updated (Pricing, Contact, Support for guests; Home, Discover, Keywords, AI Trend, Upgrade for logged-in users).
* Homepage hero updated (mockup video + typewriter animation).
* Keywords page redesigned (renamed to "Research Tools", enhanced filters, dropdowns, Quick Stats sidebar).
* Discover page (Trending Videos filters: Outlier Score, Views, Publishing Date).
* Login/Signup modal improvements (Cancel ‚ùå button).
* Dark/Light mode toggle works (next-themes, persists).

---

## ‚ùå Current Problem

App crashes with:


Uncaught Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or 
a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. 
You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, 
or you might have mixed up default and named imports. 
Check the render method of `HomePage`.


Bolt previously flagged issues in components/Navbar.tsx:

* Unclosed <Button> tag.
* Extra ) at the end of return.

## üéØ Tasks for Replit AI

1. *Fix Syntax Errors*

   * Correct <Button> tag closure in components/Navbar.tsx.
   * Remove the duplicate ) at the end of return.

2. *Check Imports/Exports*

   * Verify HomePage, Navbar, Hero, LoginModal and other components are properly exported/imported.
   * Use export default where necessary, or update imports for named exports.

3. *Verify App Runs*

   * Run npx next dev after fixes.
   * Confirm no Element type is invalid errors.
   * Navbar renders with correct items.
   * Hero section still shows video + typewriter animation.
   * Dark/Light toggle still works.
   * Login/Signup modal opens with Cancel button.

4. *Leave Integration Hooks*

   * Add // TODO comments for backend endpoints (auth, predictions).

5. *Push Fixes to GitHub*

   * Commit changes with message:
     fix(navbar): correct syntax + export issues
   * Push branch to *GitHub repo linked to Vercel*:
     nextrend-website-1
   * Merge changes into main so Vercel auto-deploys to:
     *[https://nextrend-website-1.vercel.app](https://nextrend-website-1.vercel.app)*

## üìå Important Notes

* *Do not redesign UI* ‚Äî only bugfix + structural updates.
* *Dark/Light mode must remain working*.
* Must stay *responsive + accessible*.
* GitHub push is required so Vercel deployment updates automatically.

---

üëâ That way, Replit AI will know:

* where the error is,
* what to fix,
* how to test it,
* and that it must push changes to your GitHub repo for Vercel to redeploy.
